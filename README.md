Reddit Anti-Censor
==================

This project is intended to give people a way to bypass word black list on reddit. When
some moderator use censored words to silence people. Those words can be transformed to
use special char like Ã  instead of a to make the reddit word check fail. This way
bad actor can't prevent users to communicate.

One example is how the russian sub r/russia blocks all sort of words including *russia*,
*president*, *truth*... It's clear that the blacklist isn't there to prevent brigading
but prevent any non approved poster to comment about anything related to the sub itself.
